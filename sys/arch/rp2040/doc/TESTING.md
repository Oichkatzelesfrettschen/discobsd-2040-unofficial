# Tests and gates

Every test in the tree is reached through a root Makefile target, and the
targets are grouped into tiers by what the host needs. `bmake
MACHINE=rp2040 check` runs every tier; a host without one tool runs the
tiers it has and names the one it skips. The cross, qemu, mips and
board-build tiers run after `bmake MACHINE=rp2040 build`, which leaves
the kernels, the board libc and the distribution tree the gates read.

| tier | target | needs | Linux CI | macOS CI |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| lint | `check-lint` | shellcheck, ruff | yes | yes |
| host | `check-host` | host cc, `${PYTHON}` | yes | yes |
| shell conformance | `check-posix-sh` | Linux x86-64 with 32-bit libraries | yes | no: bin/sh keeps pointers in int and builds as a 32-bit binary |
| cross | `check-cross` | arm-none-eabi toolchain, capstone and pyelftools under `${PYTHON}`, a built tree | yes | yes |
| qemu | `check-qemu` | qemu-arm (qemu-user) | yes | no: Homebrew's qemu builds no user-mode emulator; the Smaller C suite links only and says so |
| mips | `check-mips` | a bare-metal MIPS cross compiler (`MIPS_GCCPREFIX`, mipsel-elf) | no: Ubuntu's mipsel-linux-gnu binutils know only elf32-tradlittlemips, not the elf32-littlemips that lib/elf32-mips.ld names | no MIPS toolchain in Homebrew |
| host package | `check-host-package` | ruff, pytest | host.yml on Ubuntu, Windows and macOS | host.yml |
| board build | `check-board-build` | arm-none-eabi toolchain, a built tree | yes | yes |

`.github/workflows/firmware.yml` runs the tiers after the warning-free
build; `host.yml` owns the discobsd-host package and packages it on
three platforms. `PYTHON` defaults to `python3` in share/mk/sys.mk and
the root Makefile and reaches every sub-make.

## Lint

`tools/check-lint.sh` runs shellcheck at error severity over every
tracked `*.sh` file and every tracked file whose first line is a sh
shebang (share/man/makewhatis.sed carries one and is a sed script, so
it is excluded by name), then ruff over every tracked Python file.
`.shellcheckrc` declares sh for the board scripts that carry no shebang
(usr.bin/true, false, nohup, lorder, unixbench). `ruff.toml` at the top
of the tree selects E, F, W, B, UP and I at line length 100; the host
package's pyproject.toml carries the same rules for its own directory.

## Host tier

Each gate compiles the tree's own source for the host, with `-Wall
-Wextra -Werror`, around a model of what the board supplies.

| gate | proves |
| --- | --- |
| `check-aout` | sys/sys/exec_aout.h's midmag macros and the layout check exec runs before committing to an image |
| `check-libc-environment` | setenv, unsetenv, putenv and getenv over a modeled environ |
| `check-libc-tempfiles` | tmpnam, tempnam and tmpfile, on the tree's and the host's libc |
| `check-id-aliases` | id, whoami, groups and logname over stubbed identity calls |
| `check-tiny-utility-multicall` | true, false and nohup dispatch, arguments, signals, priority, streams, terminal and exit status |
| `check-portable-utilities` | getopt, yes, strings and users, with write-error injection |
| `check-pdp11-reference` | the unit tests of the PDP-11 V7 reference runner (the simh run itself is `check-pdp11-v7` with `PDP11_V7_IMAGE`); the three tests that publish evidence use Linux renameat2 and skip elsewhere, saying so |
| `check-fgrep-capacity` | fgrep's allocation boundaries and its command path over regular, empty and fifo pattern sources |
| `check-config-makefile` | the config tool regenerates the tracked kernel Makefile byte for byte |
| `check-swapram-evac` | the compressed swap pool's evacuation to flash, linking the kernel's swapram.c and subr_rmap.c |
| usr.bin/pdp11 `test` | the host build of the emulator boots the V6 pack on a pseudo-terminal |
| usr.bin/stevie, kilo, menu `test` | each editor driven through a pty |
| usr.bin/tail, sort `test` | output modeled against the host for every option |
| games/keen, bubble, fifteen `test` | a seeded game played through a pty; keen's solution uniqueness against an independent counter |
| bin/sh/tests `test` | the line editor through a pipe |
| bin/tar/tests/tartest.sh | the header formats |
| usr.bin/textbox/tests/run.sh | the sbase text tools against GNU coreutils and sharutils |
| usr.bin/cpio/tests/cpiotest.sh | odc archives round-tripped through the host cpio |

`check-posix-sh` runs bin/sh/tests/posix-sh.sh, the conformance harness
against XCU chapter 2, which builds the shell as a 32-bit host binary;
a case the shell does not yet answer as POSIX does is declared `xfail`
and fails the moment the shell starts producing the POSIX answer.

## Cross tier

| gate | proves |
| --- | --- |
| `check-divider` | neither linked kernel reaches the SIO divider registers, from the ELF and from the dependency files |
| `check-swapram` | vm_swap.o, exec_hsaout.o and kern_sysctl.o agree with each kernel's Config on the SwapRAM tier and pool size |
| `check-cache-footprint` | the name, buffer and inode caches' ABI and chain invariants, the exec argument spool over modeled SwapRAM, raw swap and buffers (including the swap cursor's rotation, publication and wrap), and the evacuation model |
| `check-exec-spool` | the spool and evacuation models alone |
| `check-ufs-prototypes` | every UFS function the kernel links has a prototype |
| `check-hsaout` | the packed a.out container against header and stream corruption, truncation and forged lengths, over every image in the distribution tree |
| `check-libc-contracts` | raise and ctermid on the host, and the board libc's a.out contracts after a rebuild from clean |
| `check-flash-swap` | the raw flash swap driver's arithmetic on the host and the kernels' link map |
| usr.bin/as/tests `test` | the a.out assembler, archiver and linker: Thumb encodings against GNU as, archive names and rewrites, a linked program |
| tests/rp2040/divider_ownership | the divider verifier's positive and negative fixtures |

## qemu tier

tests/rp2040/uarea_exchange assembles the u-area exchange loop cut from
locore.S between its markers and runs it under qemu-arm, checking every
exchanged byte. usr.bin/smlrc's suite compiles each test with the
Thumb-1 back end, links it against a copy of the tree's libc with the
Boot ROM float members removed (qemu-arm maps no ROM at address 0x10,
so libgcc's soft-float stands in) and the Linux syscall layer in
tests/qemusys.c, and compares the output; `REQUIRE_QEMU=1` refuses the
link-only run the tier would otherwise silently accept.

## MIPS tier

tests/rp2040/elf2aout_layout links the same fixtures with the arm and
the MIPS toolchains and checks elf2aout's layout and the multicall bss
overlay on both. It needs a bare-metal toolchain (Arch's mipsel-elf,
the OpenBSD and FreeBSD prefixes in share/mk/mips-toolchain.mk): the
Linux-target mipsel-linux-gnu binutils reject the elf32-littlemips
output format the linker script names, so the tier runs locally and
not in CI.

## Board tier

`check-board-build` builds the on-device regression programs to a.out
through tests/rp2040/Makefile: fptest (Boot ROM float, bit-exact),
sigtest (signal frames), streamtest (NSTATIC), tartest (the -Z filter
across a pipe), romprobe (ROM table dump), textcrc (packed executable
text restoration), epochtest, evactest, bigtest and hugetest (the
SwapRAM window epoch and evacuation). None is in the root manifest:
stage one with a `file /usr/bin/<name>` line in distrib/rp2040/mi.rp2040
for a test image and revert the line before committing. Three drivers
flash a board and check it over the USB console: board_aout_admission.py
(a truncated, an oversized and an even-entry image refused with distinct
errors), board_exec_hsaout.py (textcrc raw and packed across a swap) and
board_stack_align.py.

Suites that run only on the board, because their program has no host
build or their reference output holds board addresses: usr.bin/cpp
`test`, usr.bin/picoc `test`, usr.bin/scm `tests` (closure names carry
heap addresses), usr.bin/retroforth/test, usr.bin/zmodem/ptest.sh, and
distrib/rp2040/tests (accept-div-printf.c under the board's smlrc,
accept-stdio-exec.c under the cross compiler; board-libc.md in
research/ names them).
