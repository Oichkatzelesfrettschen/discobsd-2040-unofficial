# Tests and gates

Every test in the tree is reached through a root Makefile target, and the
targets are grouped into tiers by what the host needs. `bmake
MACHINE=rp2040 check` runs every tier; a host without one tool runs the
tiers it has and names the one it skips. The cross, qemu, mips and
board-build tiers run after `bmake MACHINE=rp2040 build`, which leaves
the kernels, the board libc and the distribution tree the gates read.

| tier | target | needs | Linux CI | macOS CI |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| lint | `check-lint` | shellcheck, ruff | yes | yes |
| host | `check-host` | host cc, `${PYTHON}` | yes | yes |
| shell conformance | `check-posix-sh` | Linux x86-64 with 32-bit libraries | yes | no: bin/sh keeps pointers in int and builds as a 32-bit binary |
| cross | `check-cross` | arm-none-eabi toolchain, capstone and pyelftools under `${PYTHON}`, a built tree | yes | yes |
| qemu | `check-qemu` | qemu-arm (qemu-user) | yes | no: Homebrew's qemu builds no user-mode emulator; the Smaller C suite links only and says so |
| mips | `check-mips` | a bare-metal MIPS cross compiler (`MIPS_GCCPREFIX`, mipsel-elf) | no: Ubuntu's mipsel-linux-gnu binutils know only elf32-tradlittlemips, not the elf32-littlemips that lib/elf32-mips.ld names | no MIPS toolchain in Homebrew |
| host package | `check-host-package` | ruff, pytest | host.yml on Ubuntu, Windows and macOS | host.yml |
| board build | `check-board-build` | arm-none-eabi toolchain, a built tree | yes | yes |

`.github/workflows/firmware.yml` runs the tiers after the warning-free
build; `host.yml` owns the discobsd-host package and packages it on
three platforms. `PYTHON` defaults to `python3` in share/mk/sys.mk and
the root Makefile and reaches every sub-make.

Windows appears in `host.yml` and nowhere else. The firmware tiers want
bmake, an arm-none-eabi cross toolchain and a POSIX sh userland to test,
so the platform that runs them on a Windows machine is WSL, which is the
Ubuntu job already. What Windows does carry on its own is the
discobsd-host package: the pytest matrix runs there, and a separate job
builds the PyInstaller executables that talk to a board over USB.

## Lint

`tools/check-lint.sh` runs shellcheck at error severity over every
tracked `*.sh` file and every tracked file whose first line is a sh
shebang (share/man/makewhatis.sed carries one and is a sed script, so
it is excluded by name), then ruff over every tracked Python file.
`.shellcheckrc` declares sh for the board scripts that carry no shebang
(usr.bin/true, false, nohup, lorder, unixbench). `ruff.toml` at the top
of the tree selects E, F, W, B, UP and I at line length 100; the host
package's pyproject.toml carries the same rules for its own directory.

## Host tier

Each gate compiles the tree's own source for the host, with `-Wall
-Wextra -Werror`, around a model of what the board supplies.

| gate | proves |
| --- | --- |
| `check-aout` | sys/sys/exec_aout.h's midmag macros and the layout check exec runs before committing to an image |
| `check-kernel` | sys/kern/subr_rmap.c, the swap allocator, compiled from the kernel source and run against 411 assertions in three descriptor shapes |
| `check-libc-environment` | setenv, unsetenv, putenv and getenv over a modeled environ |
| `check-libc-tempfiles` | tmpnam, tempnam and tmpfile, on the tree's and the host's libc |
| `check-id-aliases` | id, whoami, groups and logname over stubbed identity calls |
| `check-tiny-utility-multicall` | true, false and nohup dispatch, arguments, signals, priority, streams, terminal and exit status |
| `check-portable-utilities` | getopt, yes, strings and users, with write-error injection |
| `check-pdp11-reference` | the unit tests of the PDP-11 V7 reference runner (the simh run itself is `check-pdp11-v7` with `PDP11_V7_IMAGE`); the three tests that publish evidence use Linux renameat2 and skip elsewhere, saying so |
| `check-fgrep-capacity` | fgrep's allocation boundaries and its command path over regular, empty and fifo pattern sources |
| `check-config-makefile` | the config tool regenerates the tracked kernel Makefile byte for byte |
| `check-swapram-evac` | the compressed swap pool's evacuation to flash, linking the kernel's swapram.c and subr_rmap.c |
| usr.bin/pdp11 `test` | the host build of the emulator boots the V6 pack on a pseudo-terminal |
| usr.bin/stevie, kilo, menu `test` | each editor driven through a pty |
| usr.bin/tail, sort `test` | output modeled against the host for every option |
| games/keen, bubble, fifteen `test` | a seeded game played through a pty; keen's solution uniqueness against an independent counter |
| bin/sh/tests `test` | the line editor through a pipe |
| bin/tar/tests/tartest.sh | the header formats |
| usr.bin/textbox/tests/run.sh | the sbase text tools against GNU coreutils and sharutils |
| usr.bin/cpio/tests/cpiotest.sh | odc archives round-tripped through the host cpio |

`check-posix-sh` runs bin/sh/tests/posix-sh.sh, the conformance harness
against XCU chapter 2, which builds the shell as a 32-bit host binary;
a case the shell does not yet answer as POSIX does is declared `xfail`
and fails the moment the shell starts producing the POSIX answer.

### Kernel sources on the host

`check-kernel` compiles a file from sys/kern unchanged and links it
against the harness in tests/kernel, so the gate measures the code the
board runs instead of a second copy of its algorithm. `check-swapram-evac`
links kernel sources the same way. Three properties of the tree decide the
shape of the harness, and a new gate that ignores any of them fails in a
way that looks like a bug in the kernel:

- sys/sys/types.h reads `typedef u_int size_t`, so a kernel source sees a
  32-bit size_t where a host source sees a wider one. hostkern.h therefore
  includes no system header and names no type the kernel names, and
  hostkern_kern.c is the only translation unit that includes both sides.
  A gate that reached `<stddef.h>` before `<sys/param.h>` would hand
  `malloc3()` an array of one width and get two of its three addresses
  written into the first element.
- A host binary links libc, which owns `printf`, `malloc` and `mfree`. The
  Makefile moves those names aside for the kernel source; hostkern_kern.c
  compiles with the same renames and includes both headers, so a signature
  that drifts from sys/systm.h becomes a conflicting declaration.
- sys/param.h reaches the port's headers as `<machine/*.h>`, a name
  config(8) makes in the kernel build directory. This tier has to run in an
  unconfigured tree, so its Makefile generates one forwarding header per
  port header instead.

A kernel source compiles here under `-Wall -Werror`, the set
sys/arch/rp2040/conf builds the kernel with, while the gate's own sources
take `-Wall -Wextra -Werror`. A gate that rejected code the production
build accepts would fail for something that ships.

`panic()` returns control to the harness inside `HK_EXPECT_PANIC`, which
is what lets a gate assert on the defensive checks rather than only on the
paths that return. Outside one it prints and exits, so an unexpected panic
fails the gate rather than unwinding into unrelated code.

## Cross tier

| gate | proves |
| --- | --- |
| `check-divider` | neither linked kernel reaches the SIO divider registers, from the ELF and from the dependency files |
| `check-swapram` | vm_swap.o, exec_hsaout.o and kern_sysctl.o agree with each kernel's Config on the SwapRAM tier and pool size |
| `check-cache-footprint` | the name, buffer and inode caches' ABI and chain invariants, the exec argument spool over modeled SwapRAM, raw swap and buffers (including the swap cursor's rotation, publication and wrap), and the evacuation model |
| `check-exec-spool` | sys/kern/exec_subr.c spooling arguments through the real sys/kern/subr_rmap.c reservation, over modeled SwapRAM and buffers |
| `check-ufs-prototypes` | every UFS function the kernel links has a prototype |
| `check-hsaout` | the packed a.out container against header and stream corruption, truncation and forged lengths, over every image in the distribution tree |
| `check-libc-contracts` | raise and ctermid on the host, and the board libc's a.out contracts after a rebuild from clean |
| `check-flash-swap` | the raw flash swap driver's arithmetic on the host and the kernels' link map |
| usr.bin/as/tests `test` | the a.out assembler, archiver and linker: Thumb encodings against GNU as, archive names and rewrites, a linked program |
| tests/rp2040/divider_ownership | the divider verifier's positive and negative fixtures |

## qemu tier

tests/rp2040/uarea_exchange assembles the u-area exchange loop cut from
locore.S between its markers and runs it under qemu-arm, checking every
exchanged byte. usr.bin/smlrc's suite compiles each test with the
Thumb-1 back end, links it against a copy of the tree's libc with the
Boot ROM float members removed (qemu-arm maps no ROM at address 0x10,
so libgcc's soft-float stands in) and the Linux syscall layer in
tests/qemusys.c, and compares the output; `REQUIRE_QEMU=1` refuses the
link-only run the tier would otherwise silently accept.

## MIPS tier

tests/rp2040/elf2aout_layout links the same fixtures with the arm and
the MIPS toolchains and checks elf2aout's layout and the multicall bss
overlay on both. It needs a bare-metal toolchain (Arch's mipsel-elf,
the OpenBSD and FreeBSD prefixes in share/mk/mips-toolchain.mk): the
Linux-target mipsel-linux-gnu binutils reject the elf32-littlemips
output format the linker script names, so the tier runs locally and
not in CI.

## Board tier

`check-board-build` builds the on-device regression programs to a.out
through tests/rp2040/Makefile: fptest (Boot ROM float, bit-exact),
sigtest (signal frames), streamtest (NSTATIC), tartest (the -Z filter
across a pipe), romprobe (ROM table dump), textcrc (packed executable
text restoration), epochtest, evactest, bigtest and hugetest (the
SwapRAM window epoch and evacuation). None is in the root manifest:
stage one with a `file /usr/bin/<name>` line in distrib/rp2040/mi.rp2040
for a test image and revert the line before committing. Three drivers
flash a board and check it over the USB console: board_aout_admission.py
(a truncated, an oversized and an even-entry image refused with distinct
errors), board_exec_hsaout.py (textcrc raw and packed across a swap) and
board_stack_align.py.

Suites that run only on the board, because their program has no host
build or their reference output holds board addresses: usr.bin/cpp
`test`, usr.bin/picoc `test`, usr.bin/scm `tests` (closure names carry
heap addresses), usr.bin/retroforth/test, usr.bin/zmodem/ptest.sh, and
distrib/rp2040/tests (accept-div-printf.c under the board's smlrc,
accept-stdio-exec.c under the cross compiler; board-libc.md in
research/ names them).
